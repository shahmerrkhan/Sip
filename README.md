# Sip 

A mentor-discovery platform that connects people directly with mentors for quick, no-pressure conversations — no cold DMs, no scheduling back-and-forth. Built as a full-stack solo project.

## Live Demo
https://sip-lyart.vercel.app

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Auth:** Clerk (session management, webhooks for user lifecycle sync)
- **Database:** Neon (serverless Postgres) + Drizzle ORM
- **Rate limiting:** Upstash Redis + `@upstash/ratelimit`
- **Email:** Nodemailer (transactional notifications — sip requests, accept/decline, Q&A answers, check-ins)
- **AI moderation:** Groq API (flags inappropriate questions before they reach a mentor's inbox)
- **Monitoring:** Sentry (error tracking across client, server, and edge)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Video:** Jitsi Meet (mentor-hosted live rooms)

## Core Features
- **Dual-role system** — a single account can be a mentor, a seeker, or both, with role-aware navigation and a "last active role" memory so switching feels instant.
- **Sip requests** — seekers send a short message to an open mentor; mentors accept/decline from a dashboard, triggering emailed responses either way.
- **Quick Asks** — a lightweight alternative to a full request, capped at 2 questions per mentor per week to prevent spam, with AI-moderated content before delivery.
- **Sip Notes** — seekers can leave a note on a mentor's public profile after a completed sip, but only if a prior accepted request between that email and mentor exists (prevents fake testimonials).
- **XP / badges / leaderboard** — mentors earn XP and unlock badges (first-sip, regular, veteran, legend, GOAT) based on sip count.
- **Referral chain tracking** — tracks who invited whom and whether the invite converted into an actual booked sip.
- **Live rooms** — mentors can spin up an instant video room; stale rooms auto-expire server-side.
- **Automated re-engagement** — a cron job emails seekers who've gone quiet for two weeks.

## Engineering Decisions Worth Noting

**Ownership checks on every mutation.** Every PATCH/DELETE route verifies the authenticated user actually owns the resource being modified (e.g. a mentor can only answer/delete their own asks and notes — not just any ID passed in the URL). Public read routes (mentor/seeker profiles, live rooms) are explicitly sanitized to strip `clerkId`, private emails, and unshared LinkedIn URLs before returning data.

**Rate limiting tiered by risk.** IP-based limiting on the unauthenticated public request form (most exposed surface), user-based limiting on authenticated mutations, plus a domain-specific cap (2 questions/mentor/week) layered on top of the general rate limit.

**Consistent error handling.** Every API route is wrapped in try/catch through a shared `handleApiError` helper that logs to Sentry with route context and returns a safe generic message — no stack traces or raw DB errors ever reach the client.

**Race condition guards.** Accepting a sip request uses an atomic SQL increment for XP/sip count (not a read-then-write), and the request status update itself is conditioned on the row still being `pending` — closing a double-accept race where a double-click or concurrent request could award XP twice.

**XSS-safe email templates.** All user-submitted text (names, messages, questions) is HTML-escaped before being interpolated into email templates, since these are rendered as raw HTML and sent on the app's behalf.

**Cascading deletes.** Foreign keys use `onDelete: 'cascade'`, so removing a mentor (e.g. via Clerk's `user.deleted` webhook) cleanly removes their rooms, requests, notes, and asks instead of leaving orphaned rows.

**Fire-and-forget vs. blocking.** Email sends are deliberately non-blocking (`.catch()` instead of `await`) on writes where the database operation is the source of truth — a flaky email provider shouldn't turn a successful save into a user-facing error.

## What I'd Add With More Time
- Zod schema validation across all routes (currently manual validation, which works but is more verbose and less type-safe)
- Batched/joined queries for a couple of remaining N+1 patterns in low-traffic admin views
- A proper transactional email provider (Resend/Postmark) in place of Gmail SMTP for deliverability at scale
- E2E test coverage for the request → accept → note flow

## Running Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires a `.env.local` with Clerk, Neon, Upstash, Groq, and Gmail credentials (see `.env.example` if provided, or reach out).
